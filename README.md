ML Fundamentals Checkpoint

This checkpoint is designed to test my understanding of the content from the Machine Learning Fundamentals Cumulative Lab.

Specifically, this will cover:

* Performing a train-test split to evaluate model performance on unseen data
* Applying appropriate preprocessing steps to training and test data
* Identifying overfitting and underfitting
